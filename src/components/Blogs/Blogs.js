            <h2>Question - 1: What is Semantics tag </h2>

            <p>Semantics defines the meaning of words and phrases, i.e.
                Semantic elements= elements with a meaning. Semantic elements have a simple and clear
                meaning for both, the browser and the developer.
                For example:
                In HTML4 we have seen "div", "span" etc. are which are non-semantic elements. They don't
                tell anything about its content.On the other hand, "form", "table", and "article" etc.
                are semantic elements because they clearly define their content.HTML5 semantic
                elements are supported by all major browsers This is so difficult for search
                engines to identify the correct web page content. Now in HTML5 elements
                ("header" "footer" "nav" "section" "article"), this will become easier.
                It now allows data to be shared and reused across applications,
                enterprises, and communities." Semantic elements can increase
                the accessibility of your website, and also helps to create a
                better website structure.</p>
